== Rerender a Machine

Typical issues like the following, can be solved by forcing a rerender of current machine config:

- Upgrade fails when the machine config operator is degraded due to a content mismatch for files
- Unexpected on-disk state validating against rendered-master

.ssh to relevant host (chroot if going through Console)
----
chroot /host
rm /etc/machine-config-daemon/currentconfig
touch /run/machine-config-daemon-force
