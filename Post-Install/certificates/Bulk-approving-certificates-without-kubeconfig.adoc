== Reset API certificate

When a cluster was down for a long period, you might have to approve new certificates. If your existing KUBECONFIG is too old, and can not connect to API, you can use one of the master nodes as a way to approve certificates.

.Bulk approve certificates on Master node, execute the following:
----
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kube-apiserver-certs/secrets/node-kubeconfigs/localhost-recovery.kubeconfig 
oc get csr -ojson | jq -r '.items[] | select(.status == {} ) | .metadata.name' | xargs oc adm certificate approve
----
