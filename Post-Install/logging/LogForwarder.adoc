== Log Forwarder Configuration and Troubleshooting

=== LogForwarder Configuration

To troubleshoot and get insight into ClusterLogForwarder you can deploy a forwarder, which forwards to an HTTP endpoint. This will allow you to see the payload and also test your configuration of the filter capabilities.

In the following configuration the we forward to logs to an HTTP endpoint.

.clusterlogforwarder.yaml
----
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  filters:
    - drop:
        - test:
            - field: .kubernetes.namespace_name
              notMatches: my-project
      name: drop-non-my-project
      type: drop
  outputs:
    - http:
        method: POST
      name: remote-http
      type: http
      url: 'https://echo-request.pietersmalan.com/'
  pipelines:
    - detectMultilineErrors: true
      filterRefs:
        - drop-non-my-project
      inputRefs:
        - application
      name: enable-default-log-store
      outputRefs:
        - default
      parse: json
    - detectMultilineErrors: true
      filterRefs:
        - drop-non-my-project
      inputRefs:
        - application
      name: forward-to-remote
      outputRefs:
        - remote-http
      parse: json

The endpoint "https://echo-request.pietersmalan.com/" is a podman container with an container image, echoing the http interaction, with method and body payload.

The image used was ghcr.io/mendhak/http-https-echo:34 and its github page is available at https://github.com/mendhak/docker-http-https-echo[mendhak/docker-http-https-echo Github Repository]
